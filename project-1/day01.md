### E. Resources

  1. [API Resources] (https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources). Select the ones that require an API key. Make sure you ALL apply for an API key for each API you use. DO NOT SHARE API KEYS. Get your own! Otherwise you will hit the rate limit while developing.

### Things to think about:
Number of Git commit contributions
- Ensure that team member's git commit contributions are balanced. We will be looking at  GitHub’s contributions section as a metric to each team  member’s productivity.
